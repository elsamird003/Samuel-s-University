Hi there!
Welcome to Samuel's University, a mock university website designed to showcase a realistic campus experience. The project features images, descriptions, user comments, and more.
It was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
One of the key features is a PHP script that allows users to send questions or requests via email, simulating a real-world university inquiry system.


How to run?
Download the source file, and open the HTML file. :)
